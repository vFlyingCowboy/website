    "paragraph1": "Growing up my parents were separated so my childhood was kind of interesting. My dad living with my grandparents in the country and my mom living in the city made for some struggles. I grew up as any normal kid would have, drinking from a garden hose and playing in the dirt.",
    "paragraph2": "After graduating High School I enlisted in the Navy and shipped off to boot camp in September of 2017. After boot camp I went to “A School” in Pensacola Fl. After that I got my first duty station in Jacksonville FL. I have been deployed 3 times with this command. During my first deployment I had some terrible news. My dad had taken the life of my stepmom, I went home from that deployment knowing very little and hoping my little brother was ok. Over time I had lost the ability to talk with my brother and didn't know and still don't know when I will be able to talk with him again.",
